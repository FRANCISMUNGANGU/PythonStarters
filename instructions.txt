# We use operators to manipulate the value of operands (Values/Variables)
# Types of operators
# 1. Arithmetic operators (+,-,/,*,%,**,//)
# 2. Comparison operators (>,<,<=,>=,!=,==)
# 3. Assignment Operators (=,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=,//=)
# 4. Logical Operators (and,or,not)
# # week 2
# others , membership operators / bitwise / identity operators

#Comparison operators
# equal 4 == 5 false
# less than 4 < 5 true
# greater than4 > 5 false
# not equal 4 != 5 true
# less or equal4 <= 5 true
